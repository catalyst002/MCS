			<h2 id="BIO">Bio</h2>
			<p>Born and raised in Burbank, California, Johnny was driven to create a musical project in 2015 after discovering DIY artists like Teen Suicide and Alex G on YouTube. “They made me realize that I can [make music] myself," he explains. "I never really thought that I could sing or anything, so I never thought that I could be my own artist.” Cross pollinating these inspirations with influences like the Cure, Marilyn Manson, and Radiohead, Johnny was able to craft a lo-fi dream-pop-meets-goth-rock fusion. Hushed vocals, dreamy guitars, and swirling synths have all become a staple within the indie-rocker’s creations. Yet there’s always been a darker, grittier undertone to Johnny’s singular style.</p>
			<p>A month after Johnny’s performance, we sit down for an interview where goths congregate in swarms—Hollywood Forever Cemetery. Despite his all black outfit, Johnny is nearly unrecognizable without his signature makeup look. He admits that this social camouflage is intentional, “I'm a very anxious person most of the time, so putting myself out there freaks me out. So, I feel like the makeup kind of gives me something to hide behind."</p>

			<p>What drew you towards making music?</p>
			<p>I just listened to a lot of music growing up. It started with the Beatles, AC/DC, and Metallica. They kind of got me into it. Then when YouTube came around I started listening to newer bands like Teen Suicide and Alex G, super DIY kind of artists. They made me realize that I can [make music] myself. I never really thought that I could sing or anything, so I never thought that I could be my own artist. Instead I started a band with my friends in high school called Pile of Napkins and it was like an alternative rock kind of thing. I would produce all the music for [the band] and then my friends would lay vocals down. Eventually, I started focusing on my own thing and training my voice sort of, trying to sing. After a while I found something that fit musically, so I just started going in and spending all my time working on music.</p>
			<br>
			<p>How'd you teach yourself multiple instruments?</p>
			<br>
			<p>I taught myself how to play piano and guitar, and bass kind of comes hand in hand with guitar. With the internet and everything I was able to just look up tutorials on songs I wanted to learn and eventually just started learning how to play things by ear and from there, just experimented with writing my own songs.</p>
			<br>
			<p>How would you describe the sound of Johnny Goth?
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>I feel like I'm trying to not fit a certain genre when I make music now. So, it's hard to describe it when it comes to actually putting a name to it. When people ask what my sound is, one of the keywords I try to push is “overcast.” It just seems like it fits my kind of style, a little bit, almost like a genre name. </p>
